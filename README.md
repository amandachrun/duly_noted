# duly_noted
 Duly Noted is a simple website built for the purpose of our Trends in Technology class.
 The aim was to create a simple full-stack website using JavaScript and Golang as a backend. 
 ===========================================================================================
 Description:
 
 Our team attempted to recreate a Pomodoro-based application. Pomodoro being a time management
 method that breaks work into intervals, seperated by short breaks. In short, our project consists
 of two main features: the to-do list, and the timer.
 
 The user main input as many ask as they wish prior to setting the clock. The clock setting input
 must be put in minutes. Once the focus session has started (pressing 'Start') the user may pause
 it if need be, or reset it completely. The tasks can be crossed off, or simply deleted as well.
 The application will keep track of completed tasks.
 
 
 ===============================================================================================
 Technology used:
 
 Due to the different in skill level, and time commitment, our team decided to use the following,
 
 UI: HTML/CSS with Vanilla JavaScript, with the import of Google Fonts and Font-Awesome
 Server: Golang
 
 ==============================================================================================
 Challenges faced:
 
 1. As previously mentioned, the disparity in skills and commitment made it hard to coordinate/dedicate the work. Hence, some of the workload was heavier on some more than others.
 2. The app was previously using the localstorage to keep the list once the page refreshed, however, last minute changes had us try to incorporate a database, which did not work.
 3. Golang, overall
===============================================================================================
Running the project:

1. Execute the main.go file in the terminal
2. Open the following page: http://localhost:8000/
3. Input tasks, use timer, etc.
